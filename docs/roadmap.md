# Roadmap

This roadmap outlines our future plans and the features we're considering. We welcome contributions and feedback from the community.

## In Progress

- [ ] Write more tests to cover the library
- [ ] Improve the docs to have examples imported from actual TS files
<!-- https://vitepress.dev/guide/markdown#import-code-snippets -->
- [x] ~~Include Algolia search in the docs~~ (done via [minisearch](https://github.com/lucaong/minisearch/))

## Planned

- Offer open-source tools for comparing and building calculation methods
- Translate the docs to Arabic <Badge type="tip" text="Help Needed" />
- Re-write the library from scratch, making it reactive from the ground up [(using Vue 3 reactivity package from the core API)](https://github.com/vuejs/core/tree/main/packages/reactivity) <Badge type="tip" text="^2.0.0" />
- Add altitude to the calculation formula <Badge type="tip" text="^2.0.0" />
- Add support for `Temporal` <Badge type="tip" text="^2.0.0" />
- Offer testing utilities for reactive code

## Under Consideration

- Do we need to have daylight saving times handled in the library? If yes, what's the best way to do it?
